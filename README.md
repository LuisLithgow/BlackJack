# BlackJack

User Story
My game will entail of a normal Black Jack game but with a bit of a twist with much css styling..  
I plan on using certain CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap.
For the programming code I will use vanilla Javascript, JQuery and possibly one more JS library or framework.

My ReadMe will be updated as my project progresses.
